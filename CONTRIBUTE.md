# Contributing

**Pick a task** from [project roadmap](https://github.com/undefined-darkness/open-horizon/wiki/Roadmap) or suggest your own.

**Ask me for instructions** via [email](mailto:undefined_darkness@outlook.com) or [open an issue](https://github.com/undefined-darkness/open-horizon/issues) with your suggestion.

Please do not contribute a code acquired from direct disassembly, and when it is unavoidable, consider [clean room design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) and find somebody to work in this concept together or write a documentation that will help me to implement this feature.

Be careful with optimizations, I left some parts as it is until I'll get to know clearly how does it work in the original game.

**Fork and clone** the repo:

    git clone --recursive github.com:your-username/open-horizon.git

Also [build instructions](https://github.com/undefined-darkness/open-horizon/wiki/Build-instructions)

**Push to your fork** and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/undefined-darkness/open-horizon/compare/) or send me a patch.
